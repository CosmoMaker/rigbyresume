<h2> Objective</h2>

<p>To obtain a position that combines my expertise in slacking off, causing chaos, and occasionally pulling off big wins. Seeking a role where my natural flair for mischief and creative problem-solving can be put to good use. Looking for a laid-back work environment with a team that understands the value of having fun while getting things done (sometimes).</p>


<h2>Skills</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Mischief Management: Specializing in pranking coworkers, finding shortcuts to avoid work, and stirring up chaos.</li>

	<li>Team Dynamics (Sort Of): Occasionally contributing to team projects when absolutely necessary, but mostly just showing up and making things interesting.</li>

	<li>Problem Solving (When It Counts): Able to think outside the box and deliver when itâ€™s the last possible minute.</li>

	<li>Technology Savvy (In My Own Way): Proficient with gaming systems, video games, and any technology that can aid in avoiding manual labor.</li>

	<li>Self-Motivation: Motivated to do as little work as possible while still remaining employed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>

	<li>Occasionally saved the day (by accident) in times of park-wide disasters.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Self-Employed | 2008 - Present</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Expert in balancing work and relaxation, often developing elaborate schemes to extend break times.</li>

	<li>Negotiated multiple "extended lunch breaks" with Mordecai and other coworkers.</li>

	<li>Perfected the art of procrastination without getting caught (most of the time).</li>
